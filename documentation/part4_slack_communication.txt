# Slack Message to Product/Business Leader

Hey fellow product manager,

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to share some quick updates on the data review I conducted and get your thoughts before moving forward. Here’s a quick rundown:

## 🔍 **What I Found:**

- **Missing Data:**
  - Some user records don’t have:
    - State information (56 entries).
    - Sign-up source details (48 entries).
  - Brand records missing:
    - Brand code (234 entries).
    - Category details (155 entries).
    - Category codes (650 entries).
    - Top brand indicators (612 entries).
  - Receipt data missing:
    - Total spent (435 entries).
    - Item lists (440 entries).
    - Purchase dates (448 entries).
    - Finished and awarded date fields (over 500 entries each).

- **Duplicates:**
  - 283 duplicate user entries detected.
  - No duplicates found in brands or receipts after review.

- **Referential Integrity:**
  - Some receipts link to user IDs that don’t exist in the user dataset. Could these be test accounts or removed users?

- **Logical Inconsistencies:**
  - 13 receipts have purchase dates occurring *after* scan dates. Any known cases like pre-orders that would explain this?

---

## ❓ **A Few Questions for You:**

- Are there specific regions or user segments you’d like prioritized when cleaning the data?
- Should we exclude receipts missing total spend or estimate based on similar records?
- For missing brand categories, would grouping them under "Uncategorized" work for now?
- Are there known data migrations that could explain the user ID mismatches in receipts?

---

## 🚀 **Next Steps & Considerations:**

- Deduplicate user entries and standardize date fields.
- Partition receipt data by purchase date to speed up monthly reporting. Does that align with your needs?
- Use incremental updates in our data pipelines to improve performance and scaling without full reprocessing each time.

Let me know your thoughts or if you’d prefer a quick sync to chat through this. Thanks so much!
